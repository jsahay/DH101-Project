Individual project for DigHum 101 @ UC Berkeley Summer 2022

This Digital Humanities project seeks to explore the definition of the “literary classic” through the manipulation of a dataset of popular works out of copyright. There are several aspects to literature which will be in the scope of this project. The general topic of the project is to find what specific features make a “classic novel” a “classic”. The goal of the project is to find commonalities across the books in the dataset. Features such as author, subject matter, and complexity of the work will be emphasized. The project will attempt to go beyond the tradition of reinterpreting novels and instead compare their composition. Additionally, the project will attempt to provide a breakdown of the “classic” model that can be used to predict which novels have the highest probability of becoming regarded as a classic. This project will spotlight what characteristics are actually considered when assigning works to the literary canon. Interpretations of works vary widely when considering theoretical lenses such as formalism, structuralism, Marxism, etc. This variation is especially visible in literature as certain lenses go in and out of fashion, along with authors. While not directly analyzing the literary works in question, the project should provide context for why certain authors enter the cultural consciousness and others do not.
